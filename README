NAME
    POD2::Base - Base module for translations of Perl documentation

SYNOPSIS
        use POD2::Base;
        $pod2 = POD2::Base->new({ lang => 'EO' });

        @dirs = $pod2->pod_dirs;
        $re = $pod2->search_perlfunc_re;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is an abstraction of the code in POD2::IT and POD2::FR.
    These modules belong to the Italian and the French translation projects
    of core Perl pods.

    Once a translation package had been installed, the translated
    documentation can be accessed with:

        $ perldoc POD2::<lang>::<podname>

    (where <lang> is a language abbreviation like IT, FR, TLH, etc.)

    This is guaranteed to work even for older versions of perldoc. It is not
    very convenient but always works.

    To improve the support to read translated docs, the perldoc utility
    (since version 3.14_01) was updated to find translated PODs via:

        $ perldoc -L IT <podpage>
        $ perldoc -L FR -f <function>
        $ perldoc -L TH -q <FAQregex>

    (*Note*: we hope this support ships together with the soon-to-be 5.10
    release of the Perl interpreter.)

    The objective of this class is to provide a minimum base to help
    `perldoc' and authors of translation packages to do their job.

SUBCLASSING
    If you want to write a translation package (and have some customization
    needs), your work may be diminished if you subclass `Pod::Base'.

    For example, a minimum example is provided below:

        package POD2::TLH; # Klingon

        use POD2::Base;
        our @ISA = qw( POD2::Base );

        sub search_perlfunc_re { # makes 'perldoc -f' work
            return 'Klingon Listing of Perl Functions';
        }

        1;

    And then

        $ perldoc -L tlh perlintro

    will present you the introduction of Perl in Klingon language (provided
    a POD2/TLH/perlintro.pod file was shipped together with POD2/TLH.pm) and

        $ perldoc -L tlh -f pack

    will find you the Klingon documentation of `pack' (if
    POD2/TLH/perlfunc.pod was made available as well).

METHODS
    This module has been made into a proper class with a very small API.

    new
            $pod2 = POD2::Base->new(\%args);
            $pod2 = POD2::ANY->new();

        The constructor. An actual call might look like this:

            $pod2 = POD2::Base->new({ lang => 'tlh' });

        where (by now) "lang" is the only argument that matters.

        If `POD2::ANY' is a subclass of `POD2::Base', the inherited
        constructor will work without arguments pulling 'ANY' from the
        package name and using it as the intented language code.

    pod_dirs
            @dirs = $pod2->pod_dirs;

        Used by `Pod::Perldoc' to find out where to look for translated
        pods.

        The `POD2::Base' default behavior is to find out the path of
        POD2/<lang>/ directory in the current Perl installation.

    search_perlfunc_re
            $re = $pod2->search_perlfunc_re; 

        To implement `perldoc -f <function>', the current code of
        `Pod::Perldoc' uses a hard coded string "Alphabetical Listing of
        Perl Functions" or the return of this method (in a regexp) to skip
        the introduction and reach the listing of core functions. Thus a
        translation package with a corresponding translated perlfunc.pod
        should define this method to make `perldoc -L <lang> -f <function>'
        work properly.

    There are other methods documented below. However, they will probably be
    superseded in future versions when more general methods to find and
    display metadata on translated PODs are designed and implemented.

    pod_info
            $hashref = $pod2->pod_info;

        Used by `POD2::Base' itself. The return contains some metadata on
        the translated PODs which is used by the methods `print_pod' and
        `print_pods'.

        When subclassing, you should override this with the current
        information on what POD translations the current package is
        providing.

    print_pods
            $pod2->print_pods;

        Prints all translated pods and the corresponding Perl version of the
        original files.

    print_pod
            $pod2->print_pod(@pages);
            $pod2->print_pod(); # uses @ARGV

        Prints the corresponding Perl version of the original files
        corresponding to the pods passed as arguments.

EXAMPLE
    A slightly extended version of `POD2::TLH' goes like this:

        package POD2::TLH; # Klingon

        use POD2::Base;
        our @ISA = qw( POD2::Base );

        sub search_perlfunc_re {
            return 'Klingon Listing of Perl Functions';
        }

        sub pod_info {
            return { perlintro => '5.8.8' };
        }

        1;

    And you may try:

        use POD2::TLH;
        my $pod2 = 'POD2::TLH';
        $pod2->print_pods();
        $pod2->print_pod('pod_foo', 'pod_baz', ...);
